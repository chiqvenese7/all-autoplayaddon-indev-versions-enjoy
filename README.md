some of them has instakill - autototem bypassed like 17indev 14indev and 12indev 
only 0.5indev and 0.7indev are autoplay rest of the autoplays are made by me iam their dev meaning it has all my selfcoded modules like 17indev 14indev and 11 9indevs and rest 
autoplayaddon-0.17indev - In this I have added autototem bypassed inside InfiniteAura you have to enable the Disabler module so that InfiniteAura works 
autoplayaddon-14indev - it also has 100 modules like InfiAnchorAura instakill TpCrystalAura which probably work ;)
autoplayaddon-0.6indev - in this also the autototem bypassed like you can check inside InfAura Infmaceinstantkill InfiniteMaceAura 
gcore1.21 - this is a private gcore script 1.21 but for meteorclient 
gcore-0.1.zip - thats 1.20.4 liquidbounce gcore script 
autoplayaddon-0.7indev - it has InfAnchor and other modules;
enjoy :D DoomIXI ON TOP
